# Sample Quiz app

This is a prototype demonstration of a quiz app showing user flow when he/she choses an option 
to a multiple choice question. A confetti with pop-up that says the user earned a badge is displayed when the user choses right option. Else, a message with a pop-up prompting to try again is displayed.

The prototype is implemented in React Native using TypeScript. An interactive design for this prototype is made using Figma.
